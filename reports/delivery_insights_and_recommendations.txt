PREDICTING LATE DELIVERIES IN E-COMMERCE
Business Insights & Strategic Recommendations
================================================

Project Context
---------------
Timely delivery is a critical driver of customer satisfaction in the e-commerce industry.
This analysis uses machine learning to identify orders at risk of late delivery for an
international electronics retailer. The goal is to enable proactive logistics planning
and operational optimization.

Two models were used to generate insights:
1. Logistic Regression (for interpretability and direction of impact)
2. Random Forest (for feature importance and nonlinear relationships)

The final predictive model selected was Logistic Regression due to its superior recall
in identifying late deliveries, which aligns with business priorities.


KEY FACTORS INFLUENCING LATE DELIVERIES
--------------------------------------

1. Product Weight and Cost (Strongest Driver)
---------------------------------------------
Random Forest identified product weight as the most important feature, supported by
a strong interaction between cost and weight.

Interpretation:
Heavy and high-value electronic products are significantly more likely to be delayed.
These items require additional handling, specialized packaging, and careful transport,
which increases logistical complexity.

Business Implication:
Orders involving heavy and expensive items should be flagged as high-risk and prioritized
in fulfillment and shipping workflows.


2. Discount Level
-----------------
Discount level was the most influential variable in Logistic Regression and one of the
top predictors in Random Forest.

Interpretation:
Highly discounted products are more likely to arrive late. This may be due to increased
order volumes during promotions, lower prioritization, or strained logistics capacity.

Business Implication:
Discount campaigns should be accompanied by enhanced logistics planning, including
additional capacity and priority routing for discounted orders.


3. Customer Behavior Signals
----------------------------
Customer interaction metrics such as:
- Calls per prior purchase
- Number of customer care calls

were consistently important across both models.

Interpretation:
Orders associated with frequent customer inquiries often indicate delivery issues or
higher order complexity.

Business Implication:
Customer behavior data can be used as an early warning signal. Orders with unusually
high inquiry rates should be proactively reviewed and escalated to logistics teams.


4. Shipment Mode and Warehouse Location
---------------------------------------
Shipment mode (Road and Ship) and specific warehouses (B, D, F) were associated with
higher delay risk.

Interpretation:
Slower transportation methods and underperforming warehouses contribute to delivery delays.

Business Implication:
- Time-sensitive orders should preferentially use faster shipment modes.
- Operational audits should focus on warehouses with consistently higher delay risk.


5. Product Importance and Customer Rating
-----------------------------------------
Higher product importance and customer ratings slightly reduce the likelihood of late delivery.

Interpretation:
Priority handling mechanisms are effective but limited in scope.

Business Implication:
Expanding priority handling rules to include additional high-risk orders could further
reduce delays.


STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS
-------------------------

1. Implement Risk-Based Order Prioritization
   - Automatically flag orders with high weight, high cost, or high discounts.
   - Route these orders through prioritized fulfillment pipelines.

2. Strengthen Logistics During Discount Campaigns
   - Increase delivery capacity during promotions.
   - Assign priority shipment methods to discounted products.

3. Leverage Customer Behavior for Early Intervention
   - Monitor calls-per-purchase ratios in real time.
   - Escalate high-risk orders before delays occur.

4. Optimize Shipment Mode Selection
   - Use faster shipment modes for high-risk or high-value orders.
   - Introduce buffer times for Road and Ship deliveries.

5. Improve Warehouse Performance
   - Conduct targeted process reviews in warehouses B, D, and F.
   - Address staffing, routing, or inventory bottlenecks.

Conclusion
----------
By combining predictive modeling with business interpretation, this project demonstrates
how machine learning can be used not only to predict late deliveries, but also to drive
actionable operational improvements across logistics, customer service, and fulfillment.
